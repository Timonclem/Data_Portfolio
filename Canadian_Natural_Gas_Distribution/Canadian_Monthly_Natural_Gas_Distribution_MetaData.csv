2,"Total deliveries to commercial and institutional consumers is natural gas sold to government institutions, public establishments, office buildings, customers engaged in wholesale or retail trade, etcetera."
3,"Total deliveries to residential consumers is natural gas sold usually for domestic purposes (for example, heating: space, water, cooking, etcetera)."
4,"In January 2016, changes were made to the Monthly Natural Gas Transmission Survey and Monthly Natural Gas Distribution Survey to provide more detailed industry data. Distribution data is now published in table 25-10-0059-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0007). Data from releases prior to January 2016 will remain available for reference purposes in tables 25-10-0035-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0001), 25-10-0032-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0002), 25-10-0033-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0003) and 25-10-0034-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0004). As a result of content and methodology changes, the current estimates may not be comparable with the estimates available in the Common Output Data Repository (CODR) previous to January 2016."
5,"Deliveries to industrial consumers by transmission systems are reported in table 25-10-0058-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0006) and deliveries to industrial consumers by distribution systems are reported in table 25-10-0059-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0007). Total deliveries to industrial consumers can be calculated by adding the deliveries to industrial consumers from both tables."
6,"Customer count data were not collected from January 2016 to December 2018, therefore the methodology used in publishing these data differ from the collected data published from January 2019 forward. Data is subject to revision."
